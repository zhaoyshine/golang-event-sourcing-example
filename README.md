Sorry, not finished yet, the overall progress is 80%.

There is still cleaning and finishing work. 
The commented code is the previous feasibility verification.

# golang-event-sourcing-example

This repository contains an example implementation of domain-driven design and event sourcing using the Go programming language. It demonstrates how to build a sample event-driven system from the ground up using core DDD and event sourcing principles.

The main goals of this project are:

- Implement a basic domain model with aggregate roots and entities 
- Handle commands and generate domain events
- Store events in an event store
- Support replaying of past events to reconstruct state
- Implement basic event handlers to handle side effects

The code is still a work in progress but covers the essential patterns and functionality. Key pieces include:

- An event store interface and in-memory implementation
- Command handlers that generate events
- Aggregate roots that apply events
- Handlers that process events after commit

This is intended solely as a learning project to explore how to properly apply DDD and event sourcing in a Go application. Comments, issues and pull requests are welcome!
